\section{Sensor Package Design}
The sensors, the micro controller unit and the additional electronics are all combined in the sensor package. Throughout testing there has been revisions on this sensor package.\\

In the Preliminary Research Report it was stated that the project would make use out of 3D designs. As it turns out that the sensor package didn't require any unique shapes, it made better sense to edit existing enclosures, like project boxes.

\subsection{Revision 1}
The initial idea was to the components in one plastic enclosure. A project box was acquired at the Nhat Tao market and holes were drilled out at the side of the box to make mounts for the the turbidity, acidity, and conductivity sensors.

The bottom of the box has screw holes drilled out for mounting the pcbs in the case. To prevent water from coming into the enclosure, O-rings are used along with sticky tack. Rubber inserts were used to close down the box. After some preliminary testing, it turned out that some water still leaked into the enclosure while fully submerged.

\subsection{Revision 2}
On the second revision, a different approach was taken. The sensitive non-waterproof PCBs were covered by a two-part epoxy, so that even if water would come into the enclosure, it would not be likely to short any circuits.\\

The PCBs are mounted on a metal holed sheet covered with conductive tape. This way, the entire box could be replaced easily in the future without dismounting any PCB's. A swivel is used to lead the cables waterproof outside the enclosure.

The sensor probes are placed outside the enclosure on a rack underneath the drone to be fully submerged in the water, while the enclosure is placed on the drone above the water.

\subsection{Secchi Disk}
To determine the turbidity, a secchi disk is used. This disk was made from an used 30cm record. Tape was used to make the black and white sides. An eye bolt was used to make a hole for the rope to attach. The secchi disk is attached to the middle of the bottom grid of the drone.
