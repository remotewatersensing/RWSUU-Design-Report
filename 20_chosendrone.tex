As seen in the Preliminary Research Report, \cite{prr} it turns out that the SwellPro SplashDrone 4 is the best option as a base for the project. While a DIY drone was considered, building a custom drone solution that was also waterproof seemed out of this project's scope.\\

As mentioned, the drone can land in the water, which opens up the possibilities of 2D/3D water quality measurements. The drone has ports on the bottom for connecting hardware via a serial connection. The addons are supplied an output voltage of xV, with a maximum current of yA. \\

This makes it possible to power a microcontroller (using a step down converter), sensors, and even a servo winch. The latter can help when building a sensor enclosure which can move to any depth of water, creating 3D water quality measurements.

The drone and its addons are entirely controllable via a TCP connection one can have with its remote controller. Data is received and transmitted via Swellpro's "Flight Control Communication Protocol". \cite{swellpronotion}
